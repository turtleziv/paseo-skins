# Architecture

Paseo Skins is a data-only theme platform around a small, reversible CDP runtime. The website discovers and creates themes; the CLI validates and applies them; the renderer injection owns only visual state. No layer may patch `Paseo.app`, execute theme-provided code, or make a remote endpoint control the desktop app.

```

- `src/theme-loader.mjs` is the single trust boundary for local Theme v1/v2 data and image integrity.
- `scripts/dreamskin-adapter.mjs` is the import boundary for public DreamSkin packages. It verifies the source package and declared files, preserves the selected image bytes, maps only declarative theme values, drops upstream CSS or executable content, and resolves reused upstream slugs with stable version-derived identifiers.
- `shared/stored-zip.mjs` owns deterministic, dependency-free Paseo ZIP creation in both Node.js and browsers. `scripts/theme-package.mjs` adds bounded upstream ZIP reading; `site/theme-package-browser.js` revalidates the selected manifest and image before creating a local download. Adapted packages contain exactly one Theme v2 manifest, one original image, and one attribution README.
- `src/remote-theme.mjs` adds HTTPS, redirect, origin, size, and cache constraints before delegating to the loader.
- `src/cli-options.mjs` and `src/cli-help.mjs` are pure command-interface modules. `src/cli.mjs` orchestrates I/O and lifecycle operations.
- `src/cdp-client.mjs` owns target discovery, loopback WebSocket validation, screenshot capture, and watcher registration.
- `src/autostart.mjs` dispatches persistent Guardian setup by platform. On Windows, `src/windows-autostart.mjs` owns the current-user environment value and logon task. The task runs `src/windows-guardian-launch.vbs` through windowless `wscript.exe`; the launcher waits for Node, retries nonzero exits with exponential delays from 1 to 60 seconds, and exits on a clean code 0. `src/windows-guardian.mjs` waits for a validated Paseo loopback target, manages one watcher through its stdin stop channel, and stops the watcher when that target disappears. Public one-click commands explicitly pass `--persist`, so `apply` may install or reconfigure the Guardian; it must preserve the single-watcher lock and wait for both lock and renderer theme identity before reporting active success.
- `src/renderer-style-audit.mjs` owns the supported-page plan, renderer contrast and hover checks, structured reporting, and restoration of the original route. The CLI adapter is `scripts/audit-renderer-styles.mjs`.
- `src/stage-black-gold-skin.mjs` is serialized into the renderer. It therefore remains self-contained and must provide a complete `destroy` path.
- On hosts exposing Unistyles color variables, Paseo owns interface colors and color scheme. The skin keeps its artwork and layout transparency, using live host variables for its backdrop, selection and hover effects. This supports built-in, system and plugin themes without copying a theme registry or freezing computed control colors. Older hosts without tokens retain the manifest palette; early fallback overrides are removed when host tokens mount.
- `site/paseo-preview-frame.js` is the single DOM source for gallery thumbnails, the full simulator, and Studio. Its parent proportions mirror the current Paseo workspace shell; visual changes require comparison against a real Paseo screenshot.
- `site/styles.css` owns the public-site typography scale. Content and controls use the shared 10/11/12/13/14px tokens; only the deliberately miniaturized Paseo frame may render below 10px.
- `site/` never connects to local CDP. It operates on the public catalog and browser-local files only.

## Non-negotiable invariants

1. Theme packages are JSON plus one PNG, JPEG, or WebP image. They cannot contain executable JavaScript, SVG, fonts, or arbitrary CSS.
2. CDP endpoints and WebSocket URLs stay loopback-only and are matched to `paseo://app/` page targets.
3. The injected overlay stays `pointer-events: none`; `#root` remains visible and interactive.
4. Every modified inline style, observer, animation frame, document hook, style node, and overlay node is restored by `destroy`.
5. Interactive hover and selected backgrounds remain state-driven CSS. A computed hover color must never be frozen into an inline `!important` value.
6. Text inside an opaque interactive control keeps a WCAG contrast ratio of at least 4.5 against the control's effective background, including nested label nodes.
7. Renderer inspection includes pseudo-elements, SVG gradients, and non-hit-testable auxiliary layers; pointer hit testing alone is not visual proof.
8. `verify` checks the active theme by default. It enforces an exact theme identity only when the caller explicitly supplies `--theme` or `--theme-url`.
9. Public visual assets require a unique provenance entry. Personal dogfood themes and `tmp/` evidence are never release inputs.
10. Upstream package adaptations retain the original author, license, download URL, package SHA-256, and image SHA-256. The repository MIT license never replaces source-package terms.
11. Gallery and simulator previews share the same current-Paseo frame: 23.2% sidebar, 4.5% main toolbar, full-canvas artwork, workspace context, and composer. The sidebar preserves the current root-workspace and child-tab hierarchy, including square workspace marks, status dots, ring-only selection, long diff counters, and outline controls. A trailing workspace action must reserve its own width and never cover diff text. Do not substitute an invented task-card mock or generic grouped list.
12. `apply` never competes with an active watcher. Without `--persist`, it may start a foreground watcher; with `--persist`, it installs or reconfigures the autostart Guardian. It may return idempotent success for the same persistent theme or reject a conflicting manual watcher. A successful active result requires matching watcher and renderer theme IDs; a Paseo process already running without CDP must be reported as installed but awaiting a normal app restart.
13. Public-site text outside `.paseo-preview-frame` never renders below 10px. Metadata, provenance, buttons, code, and form help must use the shared typography tokens rather than independent micro sizes.
14. A DreamSkin popular snapshot is complete only when catalog `source.total` equals the contiguous `popularRank` collection. Gallery rendering fetches manifests only for the visible page, so collection growth does not multiply startup requests.

## Change verification matrix

| Change area | Required checks |
|---|---|
| Theme schema or loader | loader, remote-theme, catalog, creator, Studio tests; `npm run release:check` |
| Renderer injection | self-contained VM tests, destroy/restore tests, `npm run audit:renderer -- --port 9224`, `verify`, real Paseo screenshot and hover transition check; follow [`docs/RENDERER_STYLE_SAFETY.md`](docs/RENDERER_STYLE_SAFETY.md) |
| CLI command contract | parser unit tests, subprocess help/error tests, `doctor`/`status`/`verify` smoke checks |
| Website interaction | static build/tests plus desktop and 390 px real-browser interaction and screenshot review |
| Public image or manifest | integrity load, catalog uniqueness, provenance check, site link check |
| DreamSkin import or package format | adapter and ZIP safety tests, byte-identical image hash check, package attribution check, `npm run release:check` |
| Autostart | macOS plist or Windows task/unit tests and live `autostart:status`; never reinstall or restart Paseo without explicit authorization |

## Intentional non-goals

- No modification of `app.asar`, code signatures, Paseo daemon data, or Agent data.
- Platform claims must be scoped to the verified host, Paseo version, and published artifact. The Windows fork has Paseo 0.10.3 and reboot-login evidence for the hidden task. External termination of its Guardian Node child was followed by a launcher retry and verified theme injection into isolated Paseo. A passing GitHub Windows CI run for the claimed commit is required; recovery after external termination of the launcher or task remains unverified. Linux and Intel Mac have no real-device evidence.
- No desktop theme manager until a browser plus CLI demonstrably cannot cover the required workflow.
- No generic plugin abstraction until at least two real consumers need the same extension boundary.

The architecture favors one validated theme contract and one reversible runtime over feature parity with projects that control a different desktop application lifecycle.
